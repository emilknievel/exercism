# Exercism

My solutions for [Exercism](https://exercism.org) coding exercises.

## Regarding Exercism CLI
Note that cloning this project will not include the files necessary to test and submit the code to exercism.
To do that, simply run the exercism `download` command for the exercise with the `--force` flag set.

Before invoking the download, make sure that the Exercism CLI tool points to the exercism repo directory.
